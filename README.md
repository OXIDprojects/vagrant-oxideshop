Vagrant OXID eShop CE
=====================

This is an Ubuntu Virtual Machine containing OXID eShop CE, Unit Tests and LAMP development environment.

Maintainer: Tomas Liubinas

Ver: 1.0 Beta


Vagrant script is a script setting up the guest Virtual Machine on your host machine from the scratch. The guest VM is reset to the starting point every time you run the provisioning script.


Installation:
-------------

Download and Install [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/)

Download and Install [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/)

By default your guest VM is configured to be accessed from your host machine on IP 47.47.47.47. Register your VM to known host names by adding the following line to your `hosts` file:

    47.47.47.47 oxideshop local.dev

Clone this repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/tomasliubinas/vagrant-oxideshop.git

Go to the repository dir (the one where your Vagrantfile is located) and launch the box:

    $ cd ./vagrant-oxideshop
    $ vagrant up

Wait for VM to boot. After it's done your OXID eShop is ready under `http://oxideshop/` !

Notes
-----

### VM

By default VM is accessible from your machine on IP 47.47.47.47. 

You can access it over HTTP:

[http://oxideshop/](http://oxideshop/) or [http://local.dev/](http://local.dev/)

SSH:

    $ ssh vagrant@47.47.47.47

SSH login: vagrant:vagrant

Or simply by the command in your vagrant dir:

    $ vagrant ssh


### OXID eShop CE

OXID eShop is fully installed on [http://oxideshop/](http://oxideshop/)

Admin area is accesible over  [http://oxideshop/admin/](http://oxideshop/admin/)

Admin login: admin:admin

The OXID eShop source code is available on the shared dir on your host machine:
    
    C:/[vagrant dir]/public/oxideshop/
    
#### DB Reset

Use `resetdb` script to reset the oxideshop DB to the default demo data:

    $ bash /vagrant/public/tools/resetdb

Or you can always reset the full VM from your host machine:

    $ vagrant provision

#### Running Unit Tests

Unit Tests are run on your guest VM.

Go to your tests dir:

    $ cd /vagrant/public/oxideshop_ce/tests
    
Run all eShop Unit Tests:

    $ bash runtests
	
Run a single test case:

    $ bash runtests unit/core/oxarticlelistTest.php
    
Run a single test:

    $ bash runtests unit/core/oxarticlelistTest.php --filter testLoadArticleAccessoires


### Apache virtual hosts

You can add virtual hosts to apache by adding a file to the `data_bags/sites`
directory. A docroot will be created automatically in the `public` folder, or 
you may specify a docroot explicitly by adding a docroot key in the json file.  

### phpMyAdmin

phpMyAdmin is available on every domain. For example:

    http://oxideshop/phpmyadmin
    
Try root:root to login.

### Xdebug and webgrind

Xdebug is configured to connect back to your host machine on port 9000 when 
starting a debug session from a browser running on your host. A debug session is 
started by appending GET variable XDEBUG_SESSION_START to the URL (if you use an 
integrated debugger like Eclipse PDT, it will do this for you).

Xdebug is also configured to generate cachegrind profile output on demand by 
adding GET variable XDEBUG_PROFILE to your URL. For example:

    http://oxideshop/index.php?XDEBUG_PROFILE

Webgrind is available on each domain. For example:

    http://oxideshop/webgrind

It looks for cachegrind files in the `/tmp` directory, where Xdebug leaves them.

**Note:** Xdebug uses the default value for xdebug.profiler_output_name, which 
means the output filename only includes the process ID as a unique part. This 
was done to prevent a real need to clean out cachgrind files. If you wish to 
configure xdebug to always generate profiler output 
(`xdebug.profiler_enable = 1`), you *will* need to change this setting to 
something like
 
    xdebug.profiler_output_name = cachegrind.out.%t.%p
    
so your call to webgrind will not overwrite the file for the process that 
happens to serve webgrind. 

### Mailcatcher

PHP is configured to send mail via MailCatcher, so you can see the emails that 
the vagrant box generates. The Web frontend for MailCatcher is running on port 
1080 and also available on every domain:

    http://oxideshop:1080

### Composer

Composer binary is installed globally (to `/usr/local/bin`), so you can simply call `composer` from any directory.
